                <dl>
                    <dt>It is difficult to represent the end product to the customers during the first steps of the model.</dt>
                    <dt>The customer is likely to be disappointed when the product is done because there are no mock-ups during the building phase.</dt>
                    <dd>This occurs because all of the elements of the project are being worked on in parallel and all of the elements need to come together to present the final product.</dd>
