                <p><b>What is a development Methodology?</b><br/><br/>
                 A development methodology helps engineers with planning, implementing, testing, and deploying 
                 their programs. Engineers will use certain models when working as a team to improve efficiency and to keep things organized.

                <p><b>Overview of the Waterfall Methodology</b><br/><br/>
               The waterfall model is considered to be the classic approach to the development lifecycle. It is also the most popular model. 
               This methodology approaches problem-solving in a linear fashion.
